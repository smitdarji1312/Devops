# Identity and Access Management (IAM) in Amazon Web Services (AWS)

## Overview
IAM manages access to AWS services and resources securely. It provides control over who can use AWS resources (authentication) and what resources they can use and in what ways (authorization).

### IAM Components
- **IAM Identities**: Users, Groups, Roles.
- **Root User**: Default administrative user with unrestricted access.
- **IAM Users**: Individuals with unique credentials for accessing AWS services.
- **IAM Groups**: Collections of IAM users. Permissions can be assigned to groups to simplify management.
- **IAM Roles**: A way to delegate access to users, applications, or services without the need to share long-term credentials.

### IAM Policies
- Define permissions for IAM identities and AWS resources.
- Written in JSON format.
- Attached to IAM users, groups, roles, or directly to AWS resources.

### IAM Features
- **Centralized Control**: Manage access centrally across AWS services.
- **Shared Access**: Enable collaboration by granting permissions to multiple users.
- **Cost**: IAM itself is free; charges apply for other AWS services accessed using IAM.
- **Multifactor Authentication (MFA)**: Adds an extra layer of security by requiring additional verification beyond username and password.

### IAM for DevOps Learning and Interviews
- **Integration with CI/CD**: IAM roles can be used to grant permissions to CI/CD tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions to deploy AWS resources.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: IAM policies can be managed and deployed alongside infrastructure using tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation.
- **Security Best Practices**: Understanding IAM is crucial for implementing least privilege principles and securing AWS environments.
- **Auditing and Compliance**: IAM provides logs and monitoring capabilities essential for compliance and auditing in DevOps environments.

## IAM Workflow
- **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of users or services.
- **Authorization**: Determines what resources users or services can access and in what ways.

## Example Uses
- Creating IAM users with specific permissions.
- Managing permissions via IAM groups.
- Assigning roles to AWS services like EC2 or Lambda functions.
